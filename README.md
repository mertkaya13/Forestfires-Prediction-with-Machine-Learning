This is the project I created using ICU's Forest Fire dataset.

Problem is defined as regression but data consists mostly 0 which results in bigger MSE 
this is why I transformed the problem into classification in the second part of colab.

Explanation for each part and UI for predictions with user input is on colab link.

In the some decision points I inspired by my AI Professor Murat Ozbayoglu's Student's (Recep Bozer's) thesis which you can
find in this link : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257719631_Estimation_of_the_Burned_Area_in_Forest_Fires_Using_Computational_Intelligence_Techniques
